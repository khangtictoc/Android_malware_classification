## `AndroPy_autorun.sh`

Context: 

- The tool `AndroPyTool` is well-known for extracting **static** and **dynamic** features from APKs files, also combining with reports from **VirusTotal**. But its code have some issues when running, some cases (apk files) would be failed and the whole output may be affected critically or stop the analysing process.
- Also, we encounter problem with VirusTotal API requests quotas and other trivia things relating to running tool by docker container

Functionality: 

This script will help you: 
- Run the tools smoothly without corruption (when a file is failed in extraction process, we would process next file in the queue(folder))
- Check whether VirusTotal API Key limit is still available. If not, you should add a new key. (There is a default key in this script)
- By default, the script will execute with `-all` and `-vt` option for fully extracting
- Print out the number of files successfully extracted and the failures.

Command: 

Warnings: If you install docker with root privilege, you should use `sudo` when running this script.
```
./AndroPy_autorun.sh [SRC_DIR] [DES_DIR] [TEMP_DIR]
```

Use `-h` for more information.

## `rename_apk.sh`

Context: Some extracted files would have arbitary extension like `d3jkd9dkj345dfllsd3495.dkjllsldkj23909df9s9df9d9s0ad`. We should rename the extension to `.apk`

Command: `./rename_apk.sh`

## `time_executed.sh`

Context:  Print out time executing when using **AndroPyTool** to analyse files in a **folder**. Useful to measure execution time for 1 or n files 

Command: `./time_executed.sh`

## `split-folder.py`

Context: **AndroPyTool** takes much time when handling with multiple files at a same time. We should split the number of source files (i.e 600 files) into smaller one (i.e 200 files each folder) for increasing successful rate and works efficiently.

Command: `python3 split-folder.py`
