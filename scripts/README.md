## `AndroPy_autorun.sh`

Refer to: [AndroPyTool autorun](https://github.com/khangtictoc/AndroPyTool-Autorun/blob/main/README.md)

## `rename_apk.sh`

Context: Some extracted files would have arbitary extension like `d3jkd9dkj345dfllsd3495.dkjllsldkj23909df9s9df9d9s0ad`. We should rename the extension to `.apk`

Command: `./rename_apk.sh`

## `time_executed.sh`

Context:  Print out time executing when using **AndroPyTool** to analyse files in a **folder**. Useful to measure execution time for 1 or n files 

Command: `./time_executed.sh`

## `split-folder.py`

Context: **AndroPyTool** takes much time when handling with multiple files at a same time. We should split the number of source files (i.e 600 files) into smaller one (i.e 200 files each folder) for increasing successful rate and works efficiently.

Command: `python3 split-folder.py`
